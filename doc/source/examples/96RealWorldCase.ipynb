    "## Description of the Experiment\n",
    "The experiment will typically involve a set of gate pulses $G_j, 0 \\leq j \\lt N_{Gates}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The template for a gate pulse $G_j$ is a sequence of $\\epsilon_i, 0 \\leq i \\lt N_{G_j}$ voltage levels held for time $\\Delta t = 1$ ns as illustrated in the figure below (with $N_{G_j} = 7$).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Template of a gate pulse](img/gate_pulse_scheme.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment defines a number of sequences $S_k, 0 \\leq k \\lt N_{Sequences}$ of the $G_j$ as $$S_k = (G_{m_k(1)}, G_{m_k(2)}, \\dots,  G_{m_k(N_{S_k})})$$ where $N_{S_k}$ is the length of sequence $k$ and $m_k(i): \\{0, \\dots, N_{S_k} - 1\\} \\rightarrow \\{0, \\dots, N_{Gates} - 1\\}$ is a function that maps an index $i$ to the $m_k(i)$-th gate of sequence $S_k$ and thus fully describes the sequence. (These sequences express the sequential application of the gates to the qubit. In terms of quantum mathematics they may rather be expressed as multiplication of the matrices describing the unitary transformations applied by the gates: $S_k = \\prod_{i=N_{S_k} - 1}^{0} G_{m_k(i)} = G_{(N_{S_k} - 1)} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot G_{1} \\cdot G_{0}$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring and analysing the effects of these sequences on the qubit's state to derive parameters $\\epsilon_i$ for gate pulses that achieve certain state transformations is the goal of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, every sequence must be extended by some preceeding initialization pulse and a succeeding measurement pulse. Furthermore, due to hardware constraints in measuring, all sequences must be of equal length (which is typically 4 Âµs). Thus, some sequences require some wait time before initialization to increase their playback duration. These requirements give raise to extended sequences $S_k'$ of the form:\n",
    "$$S_k' = I_{p(k)} | W_k | S_k | M_{q(k)}$$\n",
    "where the functions $p(k)$ and $q(k)$ respectively select some initialization pulse $I_{p(k)} \\in \\{I_1, I_2, \\dots\\}$ and measurement pulse $M_{q(k)} \\in \\{M_1, M_2, \\dots\\}$ for sequence $k$ and $W_k$ is the aforementioned wait pulse. The '|' denote concatenation of pulses, i.e., sequential execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since measurement of quantum state is a probabilistic process, many measurements of the effect of a single sequence must be made to reconstruct the resulting state of the qubit. Thus, the experiment at last defines scanlines (typically of duration 1 second), which are sequences of the $S_k'$. (These simply represent batches of sequences to configure playback and measurement systems and have no meaning to the experiment beyond these practical considerations.)"
