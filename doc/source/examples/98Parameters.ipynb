We can do so be encapsulating the computation of the parameter value in a custom subclass of `Parameter`. Assuming, for simplicity, that we have some `measurement_manager` object which we can query whether or not the measurement has been made (`is_measurement_available()`) and what data was obtained (`get_data()`) and that the value of `v` shall simply be twice the measured data, this subclass might look like this:"

Our `MeasurementDependentParameter` will return `True` if no measurement data is available (in contrast, the `ConstantParameter` - which internally represents any float value passed in - always returns `False`). The `get_value` method returns the parameter value. It is only called if `requires_stop` is false. In the `MesaurementDependentParameter` class, we assume that the measured data is a single float and that we simple want to multiply it by 2 as the parameter's value. The other two methods, `get_serialization_data` and `deserialize` also must be overwritten since each `Parameter` implements the [`Serializable` interface](03Serialization.ipynb).
